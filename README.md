# Snapp

This is a personal fork of [AliHeydarii/Snapp_tailwind](https://github.com/AliHeydarii/Snapp_tailwind). The project is being rebuilt using Next.js to create a modern, component-based structure while keeping the original folder structure for reference. All styling is integrated with Tailwind CSS, and the goal is to create a fully customizable and maintainable web app.
